### Modify the following plot to change the color of all points to `"pink"`.

```{r starwars-plot}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(color = "pink") +
  labs(size = "Birth year", x = "Height", y = "Mass")
```

### Stretch goal: Add labels for title, x and y axes, and size of points.

```{r}
ggplot(data = starwars, 
       mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender, size = birth_year)) +
  geom_point(color = "pink") +
  labs(title = "Height/Mass plot",
         size = "Birth year", x = "Height", y = "Mass"
       )
```
